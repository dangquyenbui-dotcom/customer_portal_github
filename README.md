# WePackItAll - Customer Portal

## üåü Overview

The **WePackItAll Customer Portal** is a secure, modern, and robust web application built with Flask. It is designed to provide WePackItAll customers with 24/7, real-time visibility into their on-hand inventory by querying a read-only ERP database (Deacom).

This application is a complete, dual-interface system:

1.  **Customer-Facing Portal:** A secure, intuitive, and high-performance interface where customers can log in to view, filter, sort, and export their live inventory data. It is designed with a focus on usability, with features like client-side search, dynamic filters, and persistent view states.
2.  **Administrative Backend:** A comprehensive `/admin` section for WePackItAll staff to manage every aspect of the portal. It features a powerful hybrid authentication system (local admin + Active Directory) and provides tools for customer management, security auditing, session monitoring, and usage analytics.

The application is built for production, prioritizing security (hybrid auth, bot protection, DB-backed sessions, forced password resets), data integrity (read-only ERP connection), and maintainability (Flask Blueprints, service-oriented architecture).

-----

## üöÄ Core Features

### Customer-Facing Portal (`/`)

  * **Secure Authentication:** Customers log in with an email and password. All credentials are securely hashed (`scrypt` or `pbkdf2`) and stored in a dedicated local SQL database.
  * **Database-Backed Sessions:** User sessions are not just browser cookies. Upon login, a secure session ID is created in the `ActiveSessions` database table. Every user request is validated against this table, enabling features like remote session termination ("kick").
  * **Forced Password Reset:** If an admin creates an account or resets a password, the user's account is flagged (`must_reset_password`). The user is automatically redirected to a dedicated "Change Password" screen upon their first login, ensuring temporary passwords are never used to access data.
  * **Live Inventory Dashboard (`/inventory`):**
      * **Real-Time Data:** The inventory grid is populated by a direct, read-only query to the ERP database, ensuring the data is always live.
      * **Data Scoping:** Customers only see inventory associated with the `erp_customer_name(s)` assigned to their account. A special **"All"** designation grants visibility across all ERP customers, and the system can handle assignments for multiple, specific customers (e.g., `Customer A|Customer B`).
  * **Powerful Data Grid UI (`inventory_view.html`):**
      * **Global Client-Side Search:** A single search box that instantly filters the entire table by *any* text in *any* column (Part, Description, Lot, PO, etc.).
      * **Dynamic Cascading Filters:** A set of dropdown filters for **Part**, **Bin**, and **Status**. When a user selects an option in one filter, all other dropdowns are instantly re-populated to show *only* the remaining valid options.
      * **Client-Side Sorting:** Users can click any column header (e.g., Part, On Hand Qty, Exp Date) to sort the data (alphabetically, numerically, or by date).
      * **State Persistence:** All filter and sort preferences are saved in the browser's `sessionStorage`, so a user's view is preserved when they refresh the page or navigate away and come back.
      * **Data Export:** A "Download XLSX" button that instantly generates and downloads an Excel file containing *only the currently visible filtered and sorted data*.
      * **Dynamic Summary:** A footer dynamically updates to show "Showing X of Y rows" as filters are applied.

-----

### Administrative Backend (`/admin`)

  * **Secure Hybrid Authentication:** The admin login at `/admin-login` supports two independent methods, providing both redundancy and enterprise integration:
    1.  **Local Admin:** A primary super-user (e.g., `cp_admin`) defined directly in the `.env` file.
    2.  **Active Directory:** Any user who is a member of the configured AD security group (e.g., `Customer_Portal_Admin`) can log in with their standard company credentials.
    <!-- end list -->
      * The system intelligently trims email domains (e.g., `user@domain.com` is processed as `user`) to simplify AD login.
  * **Admin Dashboard (`/admin/panel`):** A central hub for navigating all administrative functions.
  * **Customer Account Management (`/admin/customers`):**
      * **Full CRUD:** Admins can Create, Read, Update, and Deactivate/Reactivate customer accounts.
      * **Live ERP Customer Assignment:** When creating or editing a user, admins can select one or more `erp_customer_name`s from a checklist populated *live* from the ERP database.
      * **Usability:** A search bar is included *inside the modal* to filter the long list of ERP customers, making selection fast and easy.
      * **Client-Side Table Filtering:** The main customer list can be instantly filtered by a live search bar, while status (Active, Inactive, All) is handled by the server.
      * **Automated Welcome Email:** When adding a new customer, a secure temporary password is automatically generated and emailed to the user with a welcome message.
      * **Admin-Initiated Password Reset:** Admins can click a "Reset PW" button for any user. This generates a new temporary password, flags the account to `must_reset_password`, and **automatically emails** the temporary password to the customer.
  * **Audit Log (`/admin/audit`):**
      * **Immutable Record:** Automatically logs all critical administrative and system actions (e.g., `CUSTOMER_CREATE`, `CUSTOMER_UPDATE`, `CUSTOMER_DEACTIVATE`, `ADMIN_PW_RESET_EMAIL`, `CUSTOMER_LOGIN`, `CUSTOMER_LOGOUT`, `CUSTOMER_SESSION_KICK`).
      * **Detailed View:** Shows timestamp, admin responsible (or 'SYSTEM'), action type, target customer (ID and email), and a detailed JSON blob of what was changed (e.g., `{'is_active': {'from': true, 'to': false}}`).
      * **Filterable:** The log can be filtered by admin, action type, or searched by customer email/ID.
  * **Active Session Management (`/admin/sessions`):**
      * **Live View:** Displays a list of all customers *currently logged in* by querying the `ActiveSessions` table.
      * **Session Details:** Shows the customer's name, email, IP address, User Agent, and last seen time.
      * **"Kick Session" Functionality:** Admins can remotely terminate any active session with one click. This deletes the session from the database, forcing the user to log in again on their next action.
  * **Usage Analytics Dashboard (`/admin/analytics`):**
      * **At-a-Glance KPIs:** Displays key performance indicators: **Active Customers**, **Logins (Last 7 Days)**, **Unique Logins (Last 7 Days)**, and **Currently Active Sessions**.
      * **Login Chart:** A Chart.js line graph visualizes "Logins per Day" over the last 14 days.
      * **Data Tables:** Shows the "Most Active Customers" (by login count) and a list of "Recent Logins" with their IP addresses.

-----

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

  * **DB-Backed Session Validation:** The system does not trust the browser's cookie alone. On every request, the `customer_session_id` from the cookie is validated against the `ActiveSessions` database table. If it's not present (e.g., due to an admin "kick" or timeout), the user is immediately logged out.
  * **AD Account Lockout Prevention (Honeypot):**
      * To prevent brute-force bot attacks from locking out valuable Active Directory accounts, both the customer and admin login pages contain an invisible "honeypot" field (`hp_email`).
      * This field is hidden from human users via CSS but is visible to bots.
      * The server will **silently reject any login attempt** where this field is filled out, effectively stopping automated attacks without any impact on real users or triggering AD lockout policies.
  * **Forced Password Reset:** Ensures temporary passwords (from creation or admin reset) are never used to access data. The `must_reset_password` flag forces the user into a password-change-only workflow until it's updated.
  * **Secure Password Hashing:** All customer passwords and the local admin password are stored using strong, one-way `scrypt` or `pbkdf2` hashes via `werkzeug.security`.
  * **Strict Read-Only ERP Connection:** The connection to the (assumed) sensitive ERP database is configured to be strictly read-only, preventing any possibility of data modification from the portal.
  * **Email as Username:** Customers log in with their email address, which is less guessable than a username.
  * **Configuration Validation:** The `config.py` file validates all necessary environment variables on startup, preventing the app from running in an insecure or broken state (e.g., missing `SECRET_KEY` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`).
